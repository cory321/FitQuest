# Mobile Calendar Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a mobile-optimized calendar with iOS-style month, week, and day views featuring segmented control switching and view persistence.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Segmented Control Component ✅
**File**: `src/components/ui/segmented-control.tsx`
- iOS-style segmented control for Month | Week | Day switching
- Animated sliding indicator with smooth spring physics
- Touch-optimized with minimum 44px height
- Haptic feedback on selection
- Responsive design with proper spacing

### 2. MonthView Component ✅
**File**: `src/components/calendar/MonthView.tsx`
- Custom-built month grid (7x5 or 7x6 layout)
- Workout count badges on each day
- Heat map visualization based on workout intensity
- Minimum 44px touch targets for all dates
- Today indicator with ring highlight
- Tap date to switch to day view
- Memoized for optimal performance

### 3. WeekView Component ✅
**File**: `src/components/calendar/WeekView.tsx`
- Compact horizontal 7-day layout
- Shows day abbreviation (Mon, Tue, etc.)
- Shows date number
- Workout indicators (dots for 1-3 workouts, badge for 4+)
- Selected date highlighting
- Today indicator
- Tap day to switch to day view
- Memoized for optimal performance

### 4. DayView Component ✅
**File**: `src/components/calendar/DayView.tsx`
- Full-page view for a single day
- Inline workout list display
- Add workout form (expandable)
- Browse templates button
- Workout sessions and individual workouts separated
- Delete functionality with haptic feedback
- Empty state with helpful messaging
- Memoized for optimal performance

### 5. Refactored WorkoutCalendar Component ✅
**File**: `src/components/WorkoutCalendar.tsx`
- Removed `react-big-calendar` dependency
- Implemented view state management (month/week/day)
- LocalStorage persistence for selected view
- Smart data fetching based on view:
  - Month view: fetches full month
  - Week view: fetches current week
  - Day view: fetches current day ±3 days for smooth navigation
- Custom navigation toolbar adapts to current view
- Swipe gestures work for all views:
  - Month: swipe to previous/next month
  - Week: swipe to previous/next week
  - Day: swipe to previous/next day
- Pull-to-refresh maintained
- Smooth view transitions with Framer Motion

## Mobile Optimizations Applied

### Touch Targets
- All interactive elements have minimum 44x44px touch targets
- Buttons sized at 44-48px minimum
- Calendar dates minimum 44px
- Week view days minimum 80px height

### Performance
- React.memo on all view components
- useMemo for expensive calculations (workout counts, calendar days)
- Efficient data fetching (only fetch what's needed per view)
- No unnecessary re-renders

### Animations
- Smooth view transitions using Framer Motion
- Spring physics for natural feel
- Segmented control sliding indicator
- Scale animations on interactive elements
- Stagger animations for lists

### Spacing & Typography
- Increased padding and gaps for better mobile UX
- Larger text sizes (base 14-16px, headers 18-24px)
- Proper line heights for readability
- Responsive sizing (sm: breakpoints for larger screens)

### Haptic Feedback
- Button presses
- Success actions (workout added/deleted)
- Warning actions (delete confirmations)
- Error states
- Navigation changes

## View Behavior

### Month View
- Grid of 35-42 days (5-6 weeks)
- Shows workout counts as badges
- Heat map background color
- Tap any date → switches to Day View for that date

### Week View
- Shows 7 days horizontally
- Current week based on selected date
- Workout indicators (dots or count badge)
- Selected date highlighted
- Tap any day → switches to Day View for that date

### Day View
- Full details for selected date
- Inline workout management
- Add workout form (expandable with button)
- Browse templates shortcut
- Shows both sessions and individual workouts
- Empty state encourages adding workouts

## Navigation Flow

1. **Month View → Day View**: Tap any date
2. **Week View → Day View**: Tap any day
3. **Switch Views**: Use segmented control at top
4. **Navigate Forward/Back**: Arrow buttons or swipe gestures
5. **Go to Today**: "Today" button in toolbar

## View Persistence
- Selected view saved to localStorage as `calendar-view-preference`
- App remembers last used view (month/week/day)
- Persists across sessions and page refreshes
